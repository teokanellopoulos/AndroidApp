# AndroidApp
An android app that displays statistics about covid-19 statistics and enables the user to make a dummy appointment.

This a simple android app that is a project for one of my universitys' courses. This app has a page displays statistics about Covid-19 vaccinations 
where the data is retrieved from an API. It has a page with a gallery with pictures which when clicked they are displayed on fullscreen. There is a
page with FAQs. Lastly it has a page where it enables the user to make a dummy appointment to vaccinate. The appointment is stored in a MySQLite database.
